## On my way to College

All my life I've lived in the same place, gone to the same school, and had the same friends. The very idea of moving to another city gives me excitement with a bitter aftertaste of nostalgia. The first chapter of my life, I figured how to get by and I just don't want to turn the page yet, but this period of introspection has brought ugly truths to the forefront of my mind. The reality of my morality becomes brutally clear as every day fades into the past. Regret stains my heartstrings with it's malicious melody, and I can't bare it. I've come to realize that the world is not waiting for me, it's running away from me like frightened prey from an unfamiliar sound. It seems like all this time has been spent learning has been time invested in the future, but it wouldn't be fair to amount these memories into nothing more than building blocks in my cathedral. I've already built something I don't want to forget. The friends and community I'm leaving behind will never leave my character. They've molded my journey as much as I did, and I hope I can find another one filled with amazing people. When tethered to a cruel world the best we can do isn't to hope. When faced with death in the distance we live. We sing and dance across velvet stages, we write and paint on blank canvasses, but most importantly we dream.
